# PokeChamps roadmap

## Context

**Last updated 2026-05-24.** 393 tests across 4 workspaces (core 286 /
server 59 / tui 32 / web 16), all green. A root `vitest.config.ts`
(`test.projects`) now aggregates every workspace's own config, so both
`npm test` and a bare `npx vitest run` from the repo root pass —
including the web package's `environment: 'jsdom'`.
Backend split complete (Phase 1–5), TUI is the primary surface, web
client is read-only viewer, server backs optional remote mode. Recent
session work has been correctness + UX gaps the user hits while
actually playing matches.

The codebase is in a healthy state to take big swings. This roadmap
groups potential work into pillars + suggests a priority ordering so we
don't get lost in low-value polish.

## Recently shipped (since the roadmap was first written)

The original "Now" tier is mostly done. What's been merged on `main`:

- **Mega evolution gimmick** — full forme/ability/item swap, candidate
  remap, X/Y variant disambiguation, standalone `m1 mega` action with
  its own +5 priority bracket, dual-forme predictions for pre-mega
  mons in the matchup grid + speed display. (A.1 / variant)
- **Ability-priority bumps in speed inference** — Prankster, Gale
  Wings (full HP), Triage, Stall now correctly skip the bracket-
  equality check (no false speed signals). Same contract as Quick
  Claw. (slice of A.2)
- **Quick Claw modifier** — `+quick` on actor; effective priority
  bumped; no speed signal. (A-adjacent)
- **Two-turn charge moves** — Solar Beam / Electro Shot / Phantom
  Force / etc. auto-detected via dex `flags.charge`; charging state
  surfaced in matchup grid. (A-adjacent)
- **Pivot moves** — U-turn / Volt Switch / Flip Turn / Parting Shot /
  Teleport / Chilly Reception / Baton Pass / Shed Tail detected via
  `selfSwitch`; pivot-follow switches tagged + skipped in speed
  inference; draft list hint. (A-adjacent)
- **Spread move modifier** — `damage.ts` auto-sets `isSpread` for
  `allAdjacent` / `allAdjacentFoes` targets; ~33% overstated damage
  fixed for Heat Wave / Earthquake / Rock Slide / Astral Barrage /
  Make It Rain / Discharge / Blizzard / Surf. (slice of A audit)
- **/undo slash command** — replaces backspace-removes-last-action
  which collided with text editing. (D.1)
- **/ask hypothetical matchup** — `/ask m1+mega vs o3` or
  `/ask Delphox-Mega vs Sneasler`. Read-only, no state change.
- **Bulk HP-update line** — `hp m1=45 m2=80 o1=30%` end-of-turn
  recovery so the user can keep up with fast-paced games.
- **HP=0 KO fix** — absolute-HP setters now auto-faint + clear active
  slot (was only happening via the damage-delta path).
- **TUI polish** — finalize spinner (PikaSpinner during heavy
  inference), clear-screen on startup, custom-bring order preservation,
  OpponentLeadPicker back-nav (Esc/Left), Clone team action,
  TeamManagement submenu, ExportPanel borderless for clean copy,
  EVs exported as PoChamps SP (0-32).
- **Inference speed** — `quickOnly: true` on BattleScreen inference
  to skip the 360k-spread coarse fallback that was blocking UI.
- **End-of-turn weather + status** — `endOfTurn.ts` (wired at
  `engine.ts`) applies weather chip with type immunities, brn/psn/tox
  damage + tox-counter ramp, and Leftovers / Black Sludge healing on
  MINE side only (opp items too uncertain to surface). (slice of A)
- **Switch-in hazards** — `hazards.ts` applies Stealth Rock (×Rock
  effectiveness), Spikes layers, Toxic Spikes (poison absorb), and
  Sticky Web (-1 Spe) on switch-in / replacement, honouring Magic
  Guard / Heavy-Duty Boots / type immunities. Wired via
  `applyHazardOnSwitchInto`. (slice of A — application only; clearing
  still open)
- **On-the-fly Pikalytics fetch** — `pikalyticsFetch.ts` hits the
  `/ai/pokedex` markdown endpoint fire-and-forget, dedups concurrent +
  failed fetches, merges into the in-memory cache and on-disk
  `data/pikalytics.<format>.json`, and is wired into the TUI. (F.2)
- **Autocomplete / suggester** — `actionSuggest.ts` derives the
  suggestion pool from which `>`-separated slot you're typing: move
  names, switch targets (restricted to the brought 4), and state-verbs
  (`heal`/`sitrus`/`brn`/...). (slice of D)
- **Switch-in ability triggers** — `abilities.ts` applies Intimidate
  (-1 Atk to foes, with immunity / Guard Dog / Defiant / Competitive /
  Rattled reactions), weather setters (Drought/Drizzle/Sand Stream/Snow
  Warning + signature weathers), terrain setters (the four Surges +
  Hadron Engine), and self-boosts (Intrepid Sword / Dauntless Shield)
  on switch-in. Opp abilities trigger only when certain (observed, or
  single-ability species). Wired into both the shared engine and the
  TUI's parallel `finalizeTurn`. (A.2)
- **Hazard clearing** — `hazards.ts` `hazardClearEffect` /
  `applyHazardClear`: Rapid Spin / Mortal Spin (own-side, +Spe), Defog
  (both sides + screens), Court Change (swap all side conditions), Tidy
  Up (both sides). Auto-detected by move name in `finalizeTurn` (engine
  + TUI). Completes the hazard story alongside switch-in application.
- **Field-setting moves** — `fieldMoves.ts` `fieldMoveEffect` /
  `applyFieldMove`: weather (Sunny Day / Rain Dance / Sandstorm /
  Snowscape / Chilly Reception), terrain (the four Terrain moves),
  Trick Room (toggle), Tailwind + Reflect / Light Screen / Aurora Veil
  (acting side). Fills a real gap — the field had a display but nothing
  set weather/TR/tailwind/screens from moves.
- **A.3 (part 1) — item removal in the calc.** Item-removing moves
  (`isItemRemovingMove`: Knock Off / Thief / Covet / Corrosive Gas /
  berry-eaters) mark the target's item gone in `finalizeTurn`; the
  prediction calc now strips a consumed/knocked item (opp via
  `opp.itemConsumed` in `predictions.defenderCandidates`, mine via a
  `myCalcSet` in the matchup grid). Still open (A.3 part 2): inferring
  the item FROM outcomes (Sash survival, Choice-lock).

- **A — Battle model completeness** — mega done, charge done, pivots
  done, spread fixed, ability-priority for speed done, EOT
  weather/status done, switch-in hazard *application* done, switch-in
  **ability** triggers done (Intimidate / weather / terrain / self-
  boosts — `abilities.ts`). Still open: Download / Trace switch-in
  abilities (need foe-stat / ability-copy logic — deferred),
  item triggers beyond Sash/Balloon/WP (Choice locks, Life Orb,
  berries), move side effects (Encore / Taunt / Disable / Magic Coat),
  Tera / Z / Dynamax gimmicks (Champions hasn't rotated to them yet).
  Hazard **clearing** now done (Defog / Court Change / Rapid Spin /
  Tidy Up — `hazards.ts`).
- **B — Inference quality** — Bayesian weighting still untouched
  (#142). Item inference still binary (#7 in old order). Speed
  inference is now reasonable for Prankster-style mons.
- **C — Decision support** — multi-turn lookahead, endgame solver
  still untouched.
- **D — TUI polish** — /undo + autocomplete suggester done; others
  (inline edit, Tab cycling, resize-aware wrap, match-end summary,
  replay) still open.
- **E — Performance** — quickOnly helps; coarse-grid cache + inference
  delta still open.
- **F — Data** — on-the-fly Pikalytics fetch shipped + wired.
  Multi-spread deliberately de-prioritised (top-1 stands unless a
  clear ~50/50 split appears).
- **G — Server / web** — still low priority.
- **H — AI** — /review (last turn), /explain (bring) opt-in. No
  expansion this round.
- **I — Testing + ops** — no CI workflow yet.

## North-star goal — end-to-end battle validation

**The long-term aim:** drive *complete* battles through the same
pipeline the TUI uses and assert two invariants at every step —
(1) **every action was possible** (legal move / switch / target /
gimmick), and (2) **every damage event is consistent** with what we
compute. This converts the damage formula and the inverse solver from
"self-consistent" into "validated against ground truth."

**Primary ground-truth source: real Pokémon Showdown replays**
(standard gen9 VGC). Chosen for external validity — the observed
numbers come from Showdown's own engine, not ours.

Two consequences shape the design:

- **Replays usually hide EV/IV spreads.** Only species / revealed
  items / abilities / moves and observed HP deltas are exposed. So
  most damage events can't use strict range containment. Instead they
  become a **consistency** check: the observed damage must be
  *reachable by some spread our engine considers* — equivalently,
  feeding the observation to `inference.ts` must not empty the
  candidate set. That makes the harness a real-world test of the
  **inverse solver**, not just the forward formula. **Open-team-sheet**
  replays, where spreads are known, get the strict `observed ∈
  [min,max]` check.
- **Champions fidelity gap.** Real replays are gen9 VGC, so Mega and
  the 0–32 SP EV scale aren't exercised. J.0–J.5 validate the shared
  core (damage / legality / inference). Champions-specific mechanics
  (Mega `resolveSpecies`, SP-scale boundaries) need the
  *authored-Champions-transcript* corpus — folded in as **J.6** once
  the gen9 harness is proven.

### Phases

- **J.0 — Replay ingest.** Fetch a replay
  (`https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/<id>.json` / `.log`) and parse
  the `|`-protocol into an internal `BattleTranscript`: ordered turns,
  each a list of events (`|switch|`, `|move|`, `|-damage|`, `|-heal|`,
  `|-status|`, `|faint|`, `|-boost|`, `|-weather|`, `|-sidestart|`
  hazards, `|detailschange|` / mega). Capture revealed sets + any
  open-team-sheet data. New `replay.ts` parser + `fetch-replay.ts`.
- **J.1 — Transcript → engine driver.** Walk the transcript turn by
  turn through `match/engine.ts` — the *same* `applyAction` /
  `endOfTurn` / `applyHazardOnSwitchInto` the TUI calls (largely the
  inverse of `turnparser.ts`). Reusing production code paths is the
  point: bugs surface where they live, not in a parallel stub.
- **J.2 — Move-possibility assertions.** Per action: move ∈ species
  learnset (`getLearnset`), switch target valid + alive, target-slot
  adjacency valid, gimmick legal (≤1 mega/battle), and turn order
  consistent with `effectivePriority` brackets (flag, don't hard-fail
  — items/abilities are hidden). Failures = parser or legality-model
  gaps.
- **J.3 — Damage consistency.** Per `|-damage|` with known
  attacker/defender/move: **(a) known spread (open sheet)** → strict
  containment, any miss is a calc bug or unmodelled modifier;
  **(b) hidden spread** → reachability, observed must be satisfiable
  by some grid spread (inference filter stays non-empty).
- **J.4 — Inference round-trip property test.** Where the true spread
  is known, assert it *survives every observation's filter across the
  whole match* — the "true spread always satisfies the filter"
  invariant. Catches over-aggressive narrowing.
- **J.5 — Corpus + CI + triage.** Checked-in replay fixtures (cached
  JSON — tests run offline/deterministic, never hit the network in
  CI). Out-of-range damage events get categorised (crit / spread /
  item / ability / field / weather / our-bug) as regression fixtures.
  Run under `npm test`; gate in GitHub Actions (ties into I.1). Track a
  pass-rate metric.
- **J.6 — Authored Champions transcripts.** Once J.0–J.5 hold,
  hand/script-author full-fidelity Champions battles (known sets, Mega,
  SP scale) to cover the mechanics real gen9 replays can't reach.

**Sequencing.** J leans on **A.2** (ability triggers) and **A.3** (item
inference) to cut false out-of-range flags, and naturally forces
**I.1** (CI). Build J.0–J.2 first — ingest + legality is independently
useful and low-risk — then layer J.3+ as the damage/inference engine
matures. Treat J as the overarching arc the other pillars feed, not a
single sprint.

**Critical files:** `packages/core/src/domain/replay.ts` **new**,
`packages/core/src/scripts/fetch-replay.ts` **new**, reuse
`match/engine.ts` / `turnparser.ts` / `damage.ts` / `inference.ts`,
fixtures under `packages/core/tests/replays/` **new**,
`.github/workflows/test.yml` **new**.

## Pillars

### A. Battle model completeness  *(highest user-visible value)*

The user finds correctness gaps every session. The damage / inference
pipeline gets a lot right but several whole mechanics aren't modelled.

- **Tera / Z-Move / Dynamax gimmicks.** Scaffolds exist (~30 LOC each)
  but only `mega` is implemented (~160 LOC). Reg M-A only uses mega
  today but Champions rotates the gimmick per regulation set.
- **Ability effects in calc + display.** Intimidate (drop opp Atk on
  switch-in), Drought/Drizzle/Sand Stream/Snow Warning, Speed Boost,
  Protosynthesis/Quark Drive on switch-in, Unburden, Trace, etc.
  Currently the calc honors abilities that affect damage formulas but
  the engine doesn't apply switch-in side effects.
- **Item triggers beyond Sash/Balloon/WP.** Berry types (Chople, etc.),
  Choice locks (Scarf/Band/Specs), Life Orb chip, Black Sludge on
  Poison-types, Eject Pack, Booster Energy.
- **End-of-turn weather + status interactions.** ✅ Shipped
  (`endOfTurn.ts`): weather chip with type immunities, brn/psn/tox +
  tox-counter ramp, Leftovers / Black Sludge mine-side. Hail/Snow
  *defensive* boost (Ice +Def) not yet applied in calc.
- **Move side effects.** Sky Drop locks both mons, Fake Out only turn 1,
  Encore, Taunt, Disable, Magic Coat, Snatch, Sucker Punch fail
  conditions.
- **Field clearing.** Defog removes screens + hazards, Court Change
  swaps them, Rapid Spin removes only own-side hazards + boosts speed.
  *(Hazard application on switch-in is done — `hazards.ts`. This is the
  removal half, still open.)*

### B. Inference quality  *(high value, harder)*

Per-opp set narrowing is binary today (a spread either matches
observations or it doesn't). Real damage observations carry probability.

- **Bayesian candidate weighting.** Each spread gets a likelihood score
  based on how well it fits ALL observations, not just survives a hard
  in/out cut. "Most likely" then picks the highest-scoring spread,
  damage ranges become probability-weighted across remaining candidates.
- **Cross-turn observation accumulation.** A single damage observation
  early in the match should narrow more after corroborating
  observations in later turns. Currently each turn's inference starts
  from the last turn's surviving candidates — good — but contradictions
  (e.g. the same opp survives X but is OHKO'd by smaller Y later) need
  recovery instead of stuck-empty candidate sets.
- **Item inference from move outcomes.** Garchomp survived a guaranteed
  KO with 1 HP → Focus Sash held. Sand-immune mon took Sand chip → no
  Safety Goggles / non-Sand-immune ability. Move chose to fail under
  Misty Terrain → Status-relevant item.
- **Speed propagation through full match.** When a new switch-in joins
  later, prior speed observations on its teammates shouldn't constrain
  it. Make sure inferOpponentSpeeds re-applies only same-mon constraints.
- **"What would I still learn from observing X?"** Surface to the user
  which observations would tighten inference fastest. Decision support
  for what to log.

### C. Decision support  *(meta-feature; lots of room)*

The matchup grid shows offense / threat / speed for the active matchup.
Beyond that:

- **Switch-in advice when current matchup is bad.** Computed today
  (BringPicker matchup grid) but not surfaced mid-battle.
- **Multi-turn lookahead.** "If I do X, opp likely does Y, then end-
  state Z." Lightweight search over reasonable opp move choices.
- **Endgame solver.** Down to 2 mons each — enumerate possibilities and
  surface the best play. Bounded enough to compute live.
- **Counter teaming from match history.** "You're 0-3 vs this opp's
  Sneasler — bring Slowking next time."
- **Probabilistic KO summary.** Per-turn "you have a 47% chance to
  close out this turn" rollup of the active matchups.

### D. TUI polish  *(small commits, high frequency-of-use payoff)*

- **/undo for the in-progress turn** — remove a specific draft action,
  not just the last one. Pick by number.
- **Inline edit of draft actions** — currently must remove + re-type.
- **Better autocomplete navigation** — Tab cycles through highlights
  instead of always picking #1.
- **Resize-aware layouts** — long lines wrap mid-token. Set explicit
  column widths or truncate gracefully.
- **Match-end summary screen** — wins/losses against each opp, MVPs,
  damage taken per mon.
- **Quick replay** — already-saved matches step through turn-by-turn
  with predictions overlay so you can see what you should've done.
- **Color-blind mode** — info conveyed by symbol + position, not just
  colour. (We use red/green/yellow heavily in matchup glyphs.)
- **Profile / preferences** — sticky toggles for /crit, /allmoves, etc.
  per user.
- **Sixel sprite integration** — the Pikachu spinner works but only as
  a /pika preview + AI-thinking indicator. Could surface mon sprites
  in the matchup grid + info panels.

### E. Performance  *(only if it bites)*

- **Sub-second inference for off-meta opps.** The 360k-candidate coarse
  grid takes ~10s when Pikalytics priors don't narrow. Cache + reuse
  per-species, parallelise the damage calls.
- **Incremental inference.** Don't re-run from scratch every turn —
  delta on the last set.
- **Sixel encoding cache.** Frames are static after first render; cache
  the encoded string per (bitmap, scale).

### F. Data + integrations

- **Multi-spread Pikalytics scrape.** *(De-prioritised — user is not
  fussed about top-K spreads yet.)* Only revisit if a species shows a
  clear ~50/50 split between two materially different spreads, where
  the single top-1 cache entry is actively misleading first-turn
  predictions. Until then, top-1 stands.
- **On-the-fly Pikalytics fetch for off-meta opps.** ✅ Shipped —
  `pikalyticsFetch.ts` hits the `/ai/pokedex` markdown endpoint
  fire-and-forget, merges into the in-memory cache + on-disk
  `data/pikalytics.<format>.json`, and is wired into the TUI
  (`BattleScreen.tsx`). The earlier "planned but never wired" note is
  stale.
- **Champions client integration.** If/when the Champions client
  exposes a battle log API, parse it directly instead of typing.
- **Showdown replay parser.** Paste a replay URL → load as a saved
  match. Shares the `replay.ts` ingest built for the J north-star goal
  (end-to-end battle validation) — build once, use for both.

### G. Server / web *(low priority — TUI is primary)*

- **Medium security items.** Per-route body limits, per-account login
  throttle, WS payload caps, generic error responses. Audit list
  exists in old plan notes.
- **Match share links.** `/match/:id/public` read-only URL surfaces the
  scout export + summary for sharing with friends.
- **Per-opp tracking across matches.** "You've played this opp 4 times,
  ELO trend, common brings."
- **Web client expansion.** Mobile-friendly layout, replay slider,
  edit-from-web. Defer until user actually uses web.

### H. AI / Claude

Per the user's standing feedback memory: AI features are opt-in, never
auto-trigger. Keep that posture.

- **Pre-bring AI suggestion** with reasoning (we have /explain on
  BringPicker — could go further).
- **Per-turn move recommendation** opt-in via `/advise`.
- **Endgame analysis** at match end summarising what worked / didn't.
- **Team build assistant** — describe a strategy, get a draft team.

### I. Testing + ops

- ~~**Root vitest workspace config.**~~ ✅ Done — root
  `vitest.config.ts` with `test.projects` aggregates all four packages
  with their own env; `npx vitest` from root now passes.
- **GitHub Actions CI.** Run `npm test` (or `npx vitest run`) on push.
  We commit + verify manually right now.
- **Coverage reporting.** No baseline metric yet.
- **Property-based tests** for inference invariants ("any spread that
  satisfies observation X survives the filter").
- **Smoke test for the TUI** — spawn the binary, send keystrokes,
  assert rendered output. Hard to do well but catches regressions
  that unit tests miss.
- **End-to-end replay validation** — the J north-star goal (see its
  own section above). The biggest single regression-safety win: real
  battles drive the production pipeline and assert move-legality +
  damage consistency. CI (I.1) is a prerequisite for running the
  corpus on push.

## Recommended priority order

Picking the highest user value per unit of effort, given the user
plays matches live + finds bugs by doing so:

**Now (next 1–3 sessions):**

1. ~~**A.2 — Switch-in ability triggers.**~~ ✅ **Shipped** — Intimidate
   (+immunity / Defiant-style reactions), weather setters, terrain
   setters, self-boosts. `abilities.ts`, wired into engine + TUI.
   Download / Trace deferred (need foe-stat / ability-copy logic).
2. **B.1 — Bayesian candidate weighting.** Replace binary in/out
   filtering with probability scores. Each candidate gets a likelihood
   given ALL observations; "most likely" picks the highest score;
   damage ranges weight by candidate probability. Task #142.
3. **A.3 — Item inference from move outcomes.** Garchomp survived a
   guaranteed KO with 1 HP → Sash. Sand-immune mon took Sand chip →
   no Safety Goggles. Move locked to one option for N turns → Choice
   item. Largest single inference-quality win after Bayesian.
4. **Audit completion (task #156).** Remaining gaps: Knock Off item
   removal, Trick/Switcheroo item swap, Encore/Taunt/Disable
   surfacing, Fake Out turn-1 gating, Sucker Punch fail conditions.
   *(EOT weather/status ticks done — `endOfTurn.ts`; hazard clearing
   done — `hazards.ts`.)*

**Soon (4–8 sessions):**

5. **C.1 — Endgame solver.** Down-to-2-vs-2 enumerable; surface the
   optimal line. Stakes are highest, computation is bounded.
6. **I.1 — GitHub Actions CI.** Run `npm test` on push. Cheap insurance
   against regressions.
7. **D — More TUI polish.** Inline edit of draft actions; Tab cycling
   through autocomplete; resize-aware layouts; match-end summary
   screen; quick-replay through saved snapshots.

   *(F.1 multi-spread Pikalytics deliberately dropped from this tier —
   see pillar F. Only revisit on a clear ~50/50 two-spread split.)*

**Later (no fixed timeline):**

9. **A.1 — Tera gimmick scaffold.** Mega's pattern is the template.
   Wait for Champions to actually rotate to Tera before spending the
   effort.
10. **A.4 — Dynamax + Z-Move gimmicks.** Champions hasn't enabled them.
11. **C.2 — Multi-turn lookahead.** Wants Bayesian inference done
    first.
12. **F.2 — Champions client API integration** if/when one exists.
13. **G.2 — Web expansion / mobile.** Only if usage grows.
14. **H — AI feature expansion.** Opt-in only, conservative scope.
    (User explicitly distrusts LLM judgement on VGC — see
    feedback_pokemon_strategy memory.)

## Verification mindset

Each item should ship with:
- Specific test coverage demonstrating the new behavior
- A way to manually smoke-test from the running TUI
- A short commit message naming what real-world scenario the change
  unblocks

Keep the suite green at every commit. Current baseline: **416 tests** (was 359 when this doc was first written).

## Out of scope (deliberately)

- Mobile apps. TUI is the primary surface.
- Multi-language UI.
- Tournament-running features (we assist players, not organisers).
- Round-tripping the scoutExport back into a Match (interesting but
  niche).
